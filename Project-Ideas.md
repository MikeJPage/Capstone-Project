# Three Capstone Project Ideas

## Idea 1

**Idea:** Global Warming and Farming Practices

This project would aim to investigate global climate trends and the relationship to farming practices. This project will be broken down into two areas of research:
1.  Are global climate metrics (e.g., land surface temperature) significantly changing over time? If so, in which direction are the changes occuring?
2.  Can changes in global and local climate metrics be predicted by the development and changes in farming practices (such as the increasing number of livestock farmed each year)?

**Data:** I propose to scrape data from this project from a variety of sources, such as data.gov, data.gov.uk, & Kaggle, etc. Due to the nature of collecting data across a variety of sources, I expect there to be repeat and missing values (across different datasets), which should form a strong basis from which to practice 'tidying' data.

## Idea 2

**Idea:** GDP and Olympic medals

This project would aim to establish if there is a relationship between a country's GDP (and potential other metrics) and olympic medal performance. This
