# Three Capstone Project Ideas

## Idea 1

**Idea:** Global Warming and Farming Practices

This project would aim to investigate global climate trends and their relationship to farming practices. This project will aim to answer the following questions:
1.  Are global climate metrics (e.g., land surface temperature) significantly changing over time? If so, in which direction are the changes occuring?
2.  Can changes in global and local climate metrics be predicted by the developments and changes in farming practices (such as the increasing number of livestock farmed each year)?

**Data:** I propose to source data for this project from a variety of sources including [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?groups=agriculture8571#topic=food_navigation), [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/farm_practices), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dorbicycle/world-foodfeed-production), [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/), [Wunderground](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api), etc. Due to the nature of collecting data across a variety of sources, I expect there to be repeat and missing values (across different datasets), which should form a strong basis from which to practice 'tidying' data in R.

## Idea 2

**Idea:** Mindfulness and Cortisol Stress Reactivity

This project would aim to investigate the effectiveness of mindfulness interventions in reducing physioloigcal markers of stress (e.g., cortisol, and blood pressure).

**Data:** I propose to analyse an open dataset from a peer reviewed [academic paper](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/bx2gvkty4c/2) by Lindsay et al. (2017). The large number of dependent variables measured will allow for a range of staticial techniques to be implemented to explore the data. With help, I would also like to find and explore additional datasets, and assess the effects of mindfulness across a variety of different outcome measures.

## Idea 3

**Idea:** Football Analytics

This project would aim to try and predict football performance based on a range of different in-game metrics.

**Data:** I will use data from the [Football Events dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/secareanualin/football-events) available on Kaggle.
